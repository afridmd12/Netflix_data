🎬 Netflix Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on transforming a raw Netflix dataset into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis and modeling. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains real-world inconsistencies such as:
•	Missing values
•	Duplicate entries
•	Improperly formatted columns
The goal is to address these issues to facilitate meaningful insights and ensure high-quality data for further exploration or machine learning applications.

🧼 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps
🔹 Handling hjMissing Values
•	Identified missing values using isnull().
•	Categorical columns (director, cast, country):
o	Filled missing entries with placeholders (e.g., "Unknown") or most frequent value.
•	Numerical columns:
o	Applied mean or mode imputation as appropriate.
🔹 Removing Duplicates
•	Used duplicated() to find and drop duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
🔹 Standardizing Categorical Data
•	Standardized entries in columns such as type, rating, and listed_in by:
o	Converting all text to lowercase
o	Trimming leading/trailing whitespace
🔹 Converting Data Types
•	Converted date_added to datetime format to enable time-based analysis.
•	Extracted numerical values from duration and created a new column duration_int:
o	Movies: duration in minutes
o	TV Shows: number of seasons
🔹 Renaming Columns
•	Renamed all column names to lowercase
•	Replaced spaces with underscores for easier referencing (e.g., Date Added → date_added)
🔹 Data Filtering
•	Removed rows with missing critical information in director, cast, and country to improve dataset quality.
